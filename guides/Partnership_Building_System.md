# System for Building and Managing Partnerships

## 1. Define Your Partnership Vision and Goals
- **Action:** Clearly articulate the "why" behind your project. Describe the vision in a short document (1-2 pages) that answers:
  - What is the core purpose of the project?
  - What kinds of skills or input are needed?
  - What kind of collaboration do you envision (e.g., creative, strategic, technical)?
- **Guideline:** Be specific yet flexible. Outline the big picture but leave room for partners to bring their unique perspectives.
- **Example:** "The goal of our game project is to create an immersive narrative experience. We need input from writers, designers, and AI specialists to explore different storytelling mechanics. This is a collaborative effort where each partner can innovate within their area of expertise."
- **Pitfall:** Avoid making the vision too broad or too vague. If partners don’t understand the purpose or scope, they may feel lost or unmotivated.
- **Inspiring Example:** *Celeste*’s development team had a clear vision for a challenging yet empathetic game, which attracted collaborators aligned with that purpose.

## 2. Create a “Partnership Playbook” Document
- **Action:** Develop a document that outlines:
  - **Your Collaboration Philosophy:** How you view partnerships (e.g., mutual respect, shared ownership).
  - **Roles and Expectations:** Clear roles for partners, including what autonomy they have and how you’ll support them.
  - **Communication Guidelines:** Preferred channels (email, Slack, Discord) and frequency of check-ins.
  - **Feedback Process:** How you provide constructive feedback and welcome input from partners.
- **Guideline:** Keep this playbook concise and easy to reference. Update it as you refine your approach.
- **Example:** Include a section like: “Feedback sessions will be bi-weekly. The goal is to discuss progress, address challenges, and identify areas for creative input. Constructive, actionable feedback is encouraged from both sides.”
- **Pitfall:** Overloading the playbook with rules can make it rigid. Keep it as a living document that evolves with the partnership.
- **Inspiring Example:** *Stardew Valley’s* creator, ConcernedApe, started with a solo vision but gradually built a community and set guidelines to expand the game collaboratively.

## 3. Finding Potential Partners
- **Action:** Start with small steps to find partners:
  - **Leverage Communities:** Engage in forums (e.g., game development communities, AI research groups) and observe who resonates with your vision.
  - **Create a Call for Collaboration:** Draft a clear and compelling call for partnership, highlighting the project’s unique aspects, what you’re seeking, and the benefits of joining.
  - **Tap into Freelance Platforms:** Use websites like Upwork, Fiverr, or Toptal to hire for small, specific tasks (e.g., a one-week concept art project) to test compatibility.
- **Guideline:** Frame collaboration as a mutual exploration, not just a job. Offer small but meaningful ways for potential partners to engage initially.
- **Example:** Post in a game dev forum: “Seeking creative collaborators for a narrative-driven game project. This is an exploratory partnership where we can experiment with storytelling mechanics using AI tools.”
- **Pitfall:** Jumping into large commitments with new partners can be risky. Start with small tasks to gauge compatibility and working styles.
- **Inspiring Example:** Indie developers often start by engaging with small communities to find collaborators who are passionate and align with the project's ethos.

## 4. Initiating a Collaboration
- **Action:** Begin with a small, low-commitment task or project:
  - Start with a “trial project” that spans 1-2 weeks, such as prototyping a game element or writing a short narrative. This will serve as an introduction and allow both sides to assess compatibility.
  - Set clear goals, scope, and success criteria in a brief document (1-page outline).
- **Guideline:** Keep early collaborations low-stakes to minimize pressure. Focus on relationship-building rather than immediate results.
- **Example:** “For our initial collaboration, let’s work on a character design prototype. We’ll aim for 3 concepts within two weeks, exploring different styles that align with the game’s theme.”
- **Pitfall:** Starting with a large, complex project can lead to misalignment. Use initial tasks to build rapport and establish working dynamics.
- **Inspiring Example:** Open-source projects often welcome first-time contributors with “good first issue” tags, guiding them into the community gradually.

## 5. Ongoing Management and Nurturing of Partnerships
- **Action:** Use the following steps to maintain and nurture partnerships:
  - **Regular Check-ins:** Schedule brief (15-30 minute) check-ins weekly or bi-weekly to discuss progress and provide feedback.
  - **Create a Shared Workspace:** Use tools like Notion, Trello, or GitHub to keep track of tasks, documents, and project status.
  - **Celebrate Wins:** Acknowledge successes, both big and small, to foster a positive and motivating environment.
- **Guideline:** Be consistent with your check-ins but keep them short and focused. Allow partners to voice their ideas and concerns.
- **Example:** Use a Notion page to track project milestones, partner contributions, and a shared feedback log.
- **Pitfall:** Over-communicating can lead to micromanagement. Maintain a balance by keeping check-ins structured and goal-oriented.
- **Inspiring Example:** Small indie teams often use collaborative tools like Discord for daily syncs, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose.

## 6. Formalizing Partnerships with Agreements
- **Action:** Draft simple, clear agreements for each partnership:
  - **Scope and Roles:** Define what each partner is responsible for and the expected time commitment.
  - **Compensation:** Whether it’s revenue sharing, royalties, or upfront payment, outline how compensation works.
  - **IP and Rights:** Specify how intellectual property will be handled.
- **Guideline:** Keep these agreements straightforward and adaptable. They are there to set expectations, not limit flexibility.
- **Example:** "In exchange for your work on character design, you'll receive a 5% share of net revenue from any commercial releases of the game."
- **Pitfall:** Overly complex contracts can discourage collaboration. Simple, flexible agreements build trust and keep partnerships dynamic.
- **Inspiring Example:** Indie studios often use profit-sharing agreements, where contributors get a percentage of sales, aligning everyone towards the project's success.

## 7. Letting Go and Fostering Independence
- **Action:** Define the areas where partners have full creative control and where you retain final decision-making.
  - Encourage partners to take ownership of their domain (e.g., storytelling, level design) and bring their creative input without waiting for direction.
- **Guideline:** Step back when partners show they can handle their roles independently. Resist the urge to micromanage.
- **Example:** “You’re in charge of the narrative arcs. I trust your storytelling instincts, so I’ll only step in if there’s a major thematic shift.”
- **Pitfall:** Micromanaging erodes trust and autonomy. Set boundaries early to foster an environment where partners feel free to innovate.
- **Inspiring Example:** Many successful indie games were created by small teams where each member had creative autonomy, leading to unique and cohesive experiences.
