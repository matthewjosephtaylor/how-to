# What is Needed in a Statement of Work (SOW)

A **Statement of Work (SOW)** should provide clear, actionable details to ensure the assistant understands what is expected and can work confidently. Below are the essential elements that a SOW must include:

## 1. Clarity of Purpose (Why)
- Clearly state the overarching goal and the reason for the work.
- Provide context to help the assistant understand how their efforts contribute to the broader objective.
- Example: "To ensure critical emails are prioritized and addressed efficiently, reducing delays and missed opportunities."

## 2. Specific Work-Product (What)
- Describe the tangible outcomes expected from the work.
- Focus on what the assistant is producing, not just tasks they perform.
- Example: "An organized email inbox with high-priority items flagged daily and a weekly summary of key communications and pending actions."

## 3. Checkpoints for Feedback (When)
- Define specific intervals or milestones where progress will be reviewed.
- Use these moments to evaluate the work-product and provide feedback or course correction.
- Example:
  - Checkpoint 1: Review after the first three days to align on initial execution.
  - Checkpoint 2: Weekly reviews to evaluate progress and provide feedback.

## 4. Tools and Access (How)
- Clearly list the tools, resources, or accounts the assistant needs.
- Include instructions for accessing these tools to avoid delays.
- Example: "Gmail access for email organization, Google Docs for report preparation, and Slack for communication."

## 5. Boundaries (Scope)
- Define what is included and excluded in the work.
- Prevent misunderstandings by setting clear expectations.
- Example: "Organizing emails is included, but drafting custom responses is out of scope."

## 6. Communication Plan
- Specify how and when communication should occur.
- Example: "Daily updates via Slack and weekly review calls on Fridays."

## 7. Success Criteria (How Itâ€™s Measured)
- Clearly define what success looks like for the work.
- Include measurable results or outcomes.
- Example: "Inbox consistently organized with no critical items overlooked, and weekly summaries delivered on time."
