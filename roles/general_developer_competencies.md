# General Competencies for Developer Roles

### Communication
- **Monotropic Focus**: Developers should maintain deep, uninterrupted focus on their tasks. Communication should not disrupt their flow unless a critical blocker arises.
- **Devlog Documentation**: Each developer maintains a daily devlog in a chat system (e.g., Slack/Discord), documenting ideas, progress, blockers, and small victories. The devlog serves as a stream-of-consciousness diary, with updates naturally as focus shifts, approximately every 20 minutes, but without rigid timing.
- **Planning & Reflection**: Begin each day with a brief 'plan of action' and end with an 'after action' reflection, summarizing accomplishments, ongoing work, and general thoughts.
- **Responsive Communication**: When immediate communication is required, prefer the fastest-response mechanisms, with chat being favored over email.

### Collaboration & Teamwork
- **Independence First**: Developers are encouraged to work independently and avoid interrupting others' focus. However, asking for help when necessary is expected—don’t waste time when a quick question could solve a problem.
- **AI-Assisted Collaboration**: Developers should maintain deep, creative collaborations with AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT), utilizing AI to help with code writing and problem-solving. While AI assists in the work, developers are ultimately responsible for ensuring the quality and standards are met.
- **Balanced Interaction**: Collaboration should strike a balance between independence and seeking advice, with AI being a critical part of that collaboration process.

### Problem Solving
- **Rapid Iteration**: Developers should focus on a tight, rapid dev-loop—try partial solutions, fail fast, and adjust quickly. The goal is to iterate quickly from idea to implementation and to seeing the results.
- **Minimal Distraction**: Ruthlessly eliminate anything that slows down the iteration loop. Keep your head in the game and maintain focus on continuously refining the solution without getting bogged down by distractions.

### Time Management
- **Functional Progress**: Developers should always have something to show by any deadline, even if incomplete, that solves at least part of the problem. Focus on demonstrating progress, not perfection.
- **Realistic Estimation**: Provide estimates and use them to improve future accuracy, but don’t make them rigid. Offer feedback if goals are unrealistic and track estimates as a learning tool, not a strict metric.
- **Continuous Demonstration**: Regularly demonstrate tangible progress before deadlines to adjust scope and align expectations with business goals. Emphasize small, iterative steps over giant leaps.
- **Direction over Deadlines**: Deadlines should be seen as business desires for direction rather than hard stops. Focus on delivering visible, incremental progress toward those desires.

### Adaptability
- **Embrace Change**: Developers should recognize that change is constant. Rapid iteration allows for quick adjustments—be prepared to abandon ineffective paths without hesitation.
- **Balance & Judgment**: Know when to explore new solutions and when to push through difficulties toward a goal. Maintain a balance between persistence and flexibility.
- **Mindset**: Follow the principle of "hold on tightly, let go lightly." Stay committed to ideas that work but be ready to shift when they don’t.
