# Statement of Work (SOW)

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to identify and document the availability of open-access IIIF image data from institutions across the web. The goal is to understand how to access this data programmatically, evaluate the technical mechanisms for data retrieval, and estimate the breadth of available data.

## What is IIIF?
The **International Image Interoperability Framework (IIIF)** is a standard for making image-based resources accessible online through a uniform API structure. It is widely adopted by museums, libraries, and archives to enable the sharing, annotating, and deep zooming of high-resolution images across platforms.

- **Official Documentation**: [IIIF Website](https://iiif.io)  
- **Overview of IIIF APIs**: The IIIF framework includes several APIs, such as the Image API and Presentation API, which standardize how images and metadata are served and consumed.

## Work-Product
1. **Google Sheet**: 
   - The primary deliverable is a continuously updated Google Sheet. This document will include:
     - A list of institutions offering IIIF image data.
     - URLs or references to access their data.
     - Technical details on how to access the data (e.g., APIs, endpoints, JSON manifests).
     - Usage guidelines, licensing terms, and conditions of access.
     - Estimates of collection size (e.g., number of items) and total data volume, where available.
     - Notes on alternative formats or partially restricted sources.

2. **Discord Devlog**: 
   - A real-time "stream of consciousness" log maintained in Discord. Entries should:
     - Be posted at least twice per work session (start and end).
     - Outline plans at the beginning of a session and summarize completed work at the end.
     - Include additional updates during the session when significant discoveries, challenges, or accomplishments occur.
     - Use screenshots or other visuals when helpful.
     - See TBD video for how to devlog examples.

## Checkpoints
- **Continuous Updates**: The Google Sheet is to be updated progressively as research is conducted. The structure and columns should be refined as needed over time.
- **Asynchronous Feedback**: Feedback will be provided via Discord based on devlog updates and Google Sheet progress.

## Tools and Access
- **Google Sheet**: A blank sheet will be provided to the assistant for documentation.
- **Discord**: The assistant will receive an invitation to a Discord server with a designated channel for devlog entries.
- **Examples**: Links to sample devlogs will be shared to guide the expected style and level of detail.

## Scope
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Large institutions (e.g., major museums, national libraries, archives) are the top priority.
  - IIIF image data is the primary focus, but alternative formats encountered should also be noted.
  - Documentation of usage guidelines and licensing terms is essential.

- **Lower Priority**:
  - Sources requiring authentication or payment should be noted but not explored deeply.
  - Smaller or lesser-known institutions can be explored after larger institutions are documented.

## Communication Plan
- **Asynchronous Communication**:
  - All communication will occur via Discord in a designated channel.
  - The assistant will use the devlog to provide regular updates and respond to feedback.

## Required Skills
To successfully complete this work, the assistant should possess the following skills:

1. **Fluency in English**:
   - Must have excellent written communication skills for devlog updates and documentation.
   - Should be able to understand and write technical descriptions clearly.

2. **Technical Proficiency**:
   - Familiarity with web protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) and APIs, including how to access and interact with data programmatically.
   - Experience with data scraping, parsing JSON, and handling structured data.
   - Ability to analyze and document usage guidelines and access mechanisms for open-access data sources.

3. **Knowledge of IIIF (or Ability to Learn Quickly)**:
   - Should understand or be able to quickly grasp what IIIF is, how it works, and its importance for accessing image collections.
   - Should be able to review and interpret IIIF documentation to locate manifests, endpoints, and data structures.

4. **Experience with Research and Documentation**:
   - Must be skilled in finding, evaluating, and organizing information from various sources online.
   - Proficiency in using spreadsheets (Google Sheets) to document findings and present data clearly.

5. **Attention to Detail**:
   - Able to accurately document technical requirements and distinguish between open-access and restricted sources.
   - Must keep consistent and thorough records of progress.

6. **Self-Directed and Organized**:
   - Comfortable working independently with minimal supervision.
   - Capable of providing regular updates and responding to feedback efficiently.

## Success Criteria
1. **Breadth of Coverage**:
   - At least 10 large institutions documented initially, with additional sources added over time.
2. **Depth of Detail**:
   - Clear documentation of URLs, technical access mechanisms, usage guidelines, and collection size estimates (if available) for each source.
3. **Technical Clarity**:
   - Google Sheet entries are detailed enough for a technically inclined individual to access IIIF data.
4. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - The Google Sheet evolves with new columns and refinements to better capture data.
5. **Regular Devlog Updates**:
   - Devlog entries are made at least twice per session (start and end), with additional updates as needed.
6. **Responsiveness to Feedback**:
   - Feedback provided via Discord is acknowledged and incorporated into the Google Sheet and ongoing process.
